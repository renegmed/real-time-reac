Pluralsight: Building Real-time Apps with React, Socket.io, and RethinkDB

https://github.com/hendrikswan/realtime-rethink-lessons

Course requirement:

	node v6.11
	yarnpkg.com

$ cd client 
$ yarn

http://localhost:3000


$ ../server
$ yarn

$ ../client
$ yarn start



02 - changed rethinkdb values pass through socket
	
$ rethinkdb 

http://localhost:8080

r.db('awesome_whiteboard').table('timers').insert({timestamp: new Date()})

07 - saving a drawing to RethinkDb 

	Publish drawing lines to RethinkDB
		Handle drawing events 
		Publish events over web socket
		Store drawing events in RethinkDB table named 'lines'


09 - Improving Rendering time

		Reference:

		Optimizing Performance - https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html

		Batching events to speed up the rendering of drawing

			Number of Component Renders == Number of batches of line Events(+1)

		
		Use of RxJS for data streaming - reactivex.io/rxjs 

		$ yarn add rxjs rxjs-compat
		 

10 - Connecting to Different Port

		http://localhost:3000/?1000  connects to port 1000 triggers a page message  
		"We've lost connection to ourt server..."
